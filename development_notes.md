# Questions v. Exercises

## Issue:

Depending on the scope of the lesson, it may or may not be condusive to exercises for the student. 

Some lend themselves to discussions more than application, like "Why is JavaScript important?" and "Where does it run?" (hello javascript)

Other topics like *strings* and *functions* are also more concept-based in their current form, but could be retrofitted to work towards exercises. 

How do you make an exercise around some of these?

## Solutions:

- Case-by-case basis (Questions *or* exercises)

- Smaller, secondary lessons that introduce workable material.
    - for example, after the arithmetic lesson, provide a brief writeup and a few exercises to go along with it. 
        - Will arithemtic lessons be too easy?

## Proposal:
Combination of the 2

For earlier topics, like arithmetic, provide questions to reflect upon;
    - "What is the order of operations?"
    - "What are some issues with large numbers in JavaScript?" and "How are they handled?"

For other topics, like *strings* and *functions*, introduce a small secondary exercise-based lesson;

- Now that you know what strings are, let's see what you can do with them! (some basic methods)
-

**hello javascript**
- Questions
- Already in place

**Arithmetic**
- Questions
- Maybe fill in the blanks? 9_9 = 81 ?
    - Too simple?
- If 

**Strings**
- Second, smaller lesson to demonstrate method and their simple application
- 4 or 5 exercises after covering a handful of common methods.

**variable binding**
- Exercises: Make the following statements `true`
```javascript
let x = // your code here
x/30 = 6
```

**conditions**
- Questions
- What will the following conditional logic equate to??

```javascript
let x = 10
let y = 2
let z = 20
x < y // false
x + y < z //true
```

**loops**
- Exercises:
- write a `while` loop that...
- write a `for` loop that...

**functions**
- Exercises:
- Write a function that:
    - Takes a string and turns it entirely uppercase
    - Takes a number and prints "odd" or "even"
    - etc. 

**I/O**
- Questions?

- Write a command line application using `process.stdin` that returns your input in lowercase.
- Bonus: make the output return in lower case with a space " " between every character.
