## Prerequisites
- Weeks 1, 2, and 3 of BCA prework track

## Goal
To challenge your understanding of CSS fundamentals, while fostering an environment for personal contribution. 

## Description
In this project, you will be putting your CSS skills to the test by creating your very own "pet instagram" in which you take a number of pictures and captions and orient them on your page! You may style these elements in any way you see fit, so long as you are completing the listed criteria and using css layout principles.

**Create a page that has the following:**

1) A "header" that fits the width of the page.

2) A 3x3 `grid` of elements that each contains images and their captions.
    - Each grid item should be its own flexbox.
        - The caption should be centered
    - The grid should be centered on the page, with a `max-width` of `1100px`
    - Each grid column should have a width of `300px`

3) A "footer" that fits the width of the page.

4) A fixed "nav bar" with links that bring the user to the top or bottom of the page
  - nav bar should be centered about halfway down the left side of page, and stays in that position regardless of scrolling.

### Bonus

- Make your grid responsive, so when the browser's width shrinks, the number of columns shrinks as well. 

Here's an example of what you're shooting for:

Again, all stylistic choices are completely up to you, so long as you accomplish the main objectives.

Happy Coding :)

## Getting Started

In the embedded glitch window below, select the name of the project in the bottom left corner. 

![project name](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/v1600871422/fortuneTellerProjectName_lpnko4.png)

From there, scroll down and select the *remix* button. This will provide you with your own unique copy of the project, which you will then use! Pay no mind to the silly name of your copy, it's randomly generated.

In this glitch environment, your code will run whenever changes are detected. To see your code in action, an in-browser option is available. Simply select the *show* button, select *Next to The Code* and begin making changes to your code!

Now, when adding any code to `script.js` you should see your changes immediately in your mini-browser.
