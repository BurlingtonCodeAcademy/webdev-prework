## Goal
To challenge your understanding of HTML fundamentals, while fostering an environment for personal contribution.

## Description
In this project, you will create a "hero profile" of an important figure, whether real or fictitious. This project is intentionally a bit open ended as far as topic, the primary focus being to challenge your HTML skills. The content, layout, and styling (should you choose attempt any CSS) are all entirely up to you, so long as you accomplish the following.

**Create a site that contains:**

1) A home page that has a header with your hero's name

2) At least 1 image of your hero* that:
    - includes a caption
    - includes alternative text
    - preferably within semantic elements (`<figure>`)

3) A *brief* synopsis of your hero

4) A nav bar that links to at least one other page
    - `about.html` has been provided, but may be changed
    - the nav bar should exist on all pages

5) A notable quote from your hero

6) A list of outstanding achievements 

7) Proper *metadata* (think `<head>`) on each page
    - Hint: provide a proper `<title>`
    - Link to your stylesheet

`*` upload images to the provided `assets` folder in the project window, and use the provided URL to direct to that image. **Be sure not to link directly to an image on someone else's page!**

### Bonus Extra Credit
- Find a video on youtube (if your hero exists in that medium) and embed it in one of your pages as an `<iframe>`
- Try playing with the CSS! Change the colors, font-size, whatever else your curiosity might yield.

Happy Coding! :)

## Getting Started

In the embedded glitch window below, select the name of the project in the bottom left corner. 

![project name](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/v1600871422/fortuneTellerProjectName_lpnko4.png)

From there, scroll down and select the *remix* button. This will provide you with your own unique copy of the project, which you will then use! Pay no mind to the silly name of your copy, it's randomly generated.

In this glitch environment, your code will run whenever changes are detected. To see your code in action, an in-browser option is available. Simply select the *show* button, select *Next to The Code* and begin making changes to your code!

Now, when adding any code to `script.js` you should see your changes immediately in your mini-browser.
