## Prerequisites: 
- Week 1 of the BCA [Software Development Bootcamp](https://www.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/software-development-bootcamp/) pre-work lessons.

## Goal

To challenge your understanding of the material covered thus far in a way that leaves you ready and wanting more.

## Description

In this project, you will be creating a browser-based "fortune teller" application that asks the user 3 questions and, based on the user's response, tells their fortune. The program's behavior is detailed below. The order of processes are deliberately laid out in such a way as to facilitate a natural progression.

define a function `tellFortune` that:

1) asks the user, "What is your name?" and stores the response in a variable `name`

2) asks the user "What is your sign?" and stores the response in a variable `sign`

3) asks the user "What color socks are you wearing?" and stores the response in a variable `color`.

4) finds the  **total number of characters (length) of the three responses combined** and stores it in a variable `num`. 

5) if `num` is even, displays a dialogue box that reads "You will change the world for the better."

6) if `num` is odd, displays a dialogue box that reads "Love and happiness is around the corner."

7) if `num` is odd **and** divisible by 3, displays "You will grow to be wealthy in wisdom."

Don't forget to call your function!


## Getting Started

In the embedded glitch window at the bottom of the page, select the name of the project in the bottom left corner. 

![project name](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/v1600871422/fortuneTellerProjectName_lpnko4.png)

From there, scroll down and select the *remix* button. This will provide you with your own unique copy of the project, which you will then use! Pay no mind to the silly name of your copy, it's randomly generated.

In this glitch environment, your code will run whenever changes are detected. To see your code in action, an in-browser option is available. Simply select the *show* button, select *Next to The Code* and begin making changes to your code!

Now, when adding any code to `script.js` you should see your changes immediately in your mini-browser.


## Submitting Your Project
