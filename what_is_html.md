## Introduction
HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s. It was built atop ENQUIRE, a means to use and share documents with other researches at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN). It has since grown into **the** fundamental building block of all websites that, when coupled with JavaScript and CSS, provides users across the world with a colorful and unique web experience.

HTML, or **Hypertext Markup Language** is a relatively straightforward *markup language* (not a programming language!) that consists of structuring a text-based *document* with *elements* that give said *document* its implicit structure and meaning. That HTML document is then read by a web browser and serves as a crucial aspect of creating web pages. HTML fundamentally answers the questions:

**Where are my headers? My paragraphs? My tables? My lists? What is important, and where does it belong in my document? What images and videos do I want, and where?**

> Note: The term *document* is used to explicitly discuss the HTML file itself, and only serves as one aspect of web page creation, crucial as it is. 

In other words, HTML is written in a *document* that, when read by the browser, ensures your page's content appears in a desired way. With it, you can answer those previous questions and more! Even when you click a link in the browser, you are utilizing HTML to navigate the web. 

### Example:

Let's say we're creating a home page, and right at the top of this home page, we want the name of our site to be displayed proudly for all to see. So, before anything else in our HTML file, we add the text:

```
The World's Greatest Website
```
Only the end result is anything but breathtaking:

<iframe  style=height:"265px"; width: "100%;" scrolling="no" title="HTML intro ex." src="https://codepen.io/burlingtoncodeacademy/embed/rNebZPe?height=265&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

</iframe>

So, in order to give this title (or *header*) a little more punch, let's create an `h1` *element* that, thanks to the default styling that comes with HTML, will increase the font-size, make the text bold, and take up an entire line in the document. In the codepen above, change the HTML to the following:

```html
<h1>The World's Greatest Website</h1>
```
Note again that, on its own, HTML is rather bland; The "flashy" functionality and styling comes later through CSS and JavaScript *on top* of HTML. But, it's important nonetheless. 


## Basic Terminology
Take the following HTML:
```html

```

    - tags and attributes
    - The DOM

## Exercises
    - Use codepens
        - create an `h1` tag with the text, "Home page"
        -
