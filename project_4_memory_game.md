## Prerequisites
- Week 1, 2, and 3 of BCA prework track

## Goal
To challenge your understanding of JavaScript utility in the browser, while building upon your current understanding of HTML and CSS as a whole.

## Description
In this project, you will create a "memory game" that consists of a 4x4 grid of 8 hidden images (each appearing twice). When *clicked*, the targeted image will be revealed. Clicking on a second image will reveal that image as well, and if they match, the two will remain revealed, providing some additional indicator that the two images match. The user may then continue guessing. If the 2 images do not match, the images are flipped over and the player is then free to guess again.

**Create a web app that has:**

1) A title
2) A 4x4 grid, centered on the page. 
3) 8 pairs of images
    - initially hidden (`opacity:0`)
    - randomly placed on board
4) Reveals images when clicked
5) Indicates when 2 images match
    - i.e. turns green
6) Hides images that do not match
7) Tracks the number of matches
8) Displays "YOU WIN!" when all images have been matched
9) Keeps the provided attribution in the bottom right corner


### Bonus Extra Credit
- Allow user to play again
- If images are not a match, keep them visible for 1 second before "flipping" them back over.
- Keep score! If a user plays more than once

### Project Demo

## Getting Started

Some information has been provided to get you started. 

First of all, the assets (images) required for this project have been included in both the *assets* directory and in an array that includes their file paths. 

A function has been provided that accepts an array as an argument and manipulates its order. 

Happy Coding! :)

![project name](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/v1600871422/fortuneTellerProjectName_lpnko4.png)

From there, scroll down and select the *remix* button. This will provide you with your own unique copy of the project, which you will then use! Pay no mind to the silly name of your copy, it's randomly generated.

Now, when adding any code to `script.js` you should see your changes immediately in your mini-browser.
