This might surprise you, but when programmers are working on a project together, they don't go desk to desk or house to house, passing a single USB stick around. Instead, the custody is shared collectively through what is known as *version control*. Like the name suggests, version control is a way to track changes to a variety of information, be it websites, documents, programs, or more. Not only does this allow for a more fluid development process, it provides a series of safety nets that a team can rely on to "roll back" changes should something detrimental arise. The team *controls* the *version* of their project. 

Arguably the most popular choice, *git* is a *distributed* version control system, meaning that while there is a "most-recent" version of the project housed in what is known as a *repository* (repo for short,) each individual working on that project will have their own copy as well, which can evenutally synchronize to this `master` branch (naming conventions are undergoing a change; it is possible you will see this referred to as `main` or `primary` in the futer). When a contributor wants to implement changes to the `master` branch, they must first undergo steps on their own computer before adding those changes to the top-level, `master` branch.

## Git Terminology 
There are a lot of git-specific terms and commands that inevitably cause some confusion in the learning process. Counterintuitive language at points can cause some serious head and heartaches, so let's try to put the problems to bed early. 

### Repositories
![cluttered library](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/c_scale,w_1080/v1599851286/books-768426_1280_lx6dgs.jpg)

### Initializing  

As mentioned in the introduction, *repositories* are where your projects live. This can be a directory on your own computer, or somewhere else altogether. 

When you turn a local directory into a git repository, it is called ***initializing***.

### Cloning
When you want to get a copy of a repository that already exists (so you can potentially make changes and contribute to it,) it is called ***cloning***. When cloning, the repository you have cloned is referred to as the *upstream*, whereas your local copy is *downstream*.

In either case, the end result is the same: you have a local copy of a git repository. Now, any changes you make in that repository can be tracked.

### Tracking
Files in your repository (working directory) can be in 1 of 2 states:
- tracked
- untracked

As the names imply, tracked files are those that git is aware of. This means that, during the last *commit**, the files that are currently being tracked were present then as well.

By that logic, untracked files are those that do not have any instance of themselves being commited.

### Commit

*commiting is the term for capturing the current state of a file or files. When files are *committed*, the state of the changed files is saved in the repository's history, or log.

Then, as you edit files, Git will compare them against the previous commit and say "Hey, these are different!" Then, if those changes were intentional, you can commit again and start that process over again.

### Staging
Before you can commit your files, you must flag them as ready for commitment by *adding* them to your list of ready-to-commit files. This is an intentional redundancy to ensure only files that have been deliberately staged are commited, updated, an tracked. 


### Pushing
![pushbroom](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/c_scale,w_1080/v1599851141/push_zc2vn1.jpg)

When files are ready to be added to the master repository (the one that all contributors are synchronizing to,) we do so by *pushing*. To push a file or files, there are a few pre-requisites, which have already been covered.

- [x] Tracked
- [x] Staged
- [x] Committed

Only then, when these files match the most recent commit, are they able to be pushed to the *upstream* repository (whatever is being contributed to.)

>Note that if files are only being tracked locally on your own machine, there is nowhere to push them to, and committing is simply a way monitor the changes for your own repository. 

### Merging
Merging is the term used to describe the consolidation of 2 repository instances. It's how changes are reconciled between your code and the code you are trying to contribute to or receive changes from.

### Branches
It is good practice to have a working copy of the `master` branch on your own machine that is as true to the upstream version as possible. This is where branches tend to shine.

Branches allow you to make a separate instance of the repository so you can play around with new features and experiment wildly without fear of consequence. By switching to a new *branch* you can create new features and implement them only if you choose to. 

## Common Git Commands

![Commands](https://res.cloudinary.com/btvca/image/upload/c_scale,w_1080/v1600095507/icons-1987176_1280_kmp5ku.png)
Now that we've gone over some of the basic jargon, let's see what they look like. 

### Note
Treat the following command as a lifeline, and your best friend:

```
git status
```
This will provide you with *tons* of valuable information in terms of your git workflow:

* what branch you're on
* what files aren't tracked
* what files have been staged for commiting
* what files have been changed since last commit
* how many commits ahead of the *upstream* repo you are (if any)

**Get in the habit of running `git status` frequently.**

### Cloning
Given a repo URL, say from github, you can copy that repository directly to your machine:

```
git clone <url>
```
Whatever directory you're in when you run this command on the CLI will now have a NEW directory inside of it with the most-recent changes. 

Cloning is arguably the easiest way to get started, as it automatically sets up remote-tracking, which is useful in comparing your version of code against what is *upstream*.

### Branches
Say you've cloned a repository, and are about to make changes. These aren't small changes, like typos, but rather a shiny new feature; your best bet is to create a new branch. Doing so is easy!

```
git branch <new-branch>
```
Note `<new-branch>` is a placeholder value that should be replaced with a relevant name for whatever you're currently working on.

Then, you can check to see what branches are available with:

```
git branch
```

Your current branch will then have a `*` next to it. You can switch to a new branch with:

```
git checkout <new-branch>
```

As with most CLI commands, you can consolidate these into one. To create a new branch and switch to it:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Now, you can make, stage, and commit these changes with 100% confidence that it won't affect your `master` branch. 


### Staging
To stage the changes to a file or files, do so with the `git add` command.


```
git add <file-name>
```
Now, that file has been screened and intentionally approved for a `commit`.

To do so with all files that have been changed, run:
```
git add .
```
Running `git status` after staging changes to be committed will list the file or files that have been staged. 

To unstage files that are ready to be committed:

```
git reset
```

### Commit

Once files have been staged with `git add`, you're ready to commit! You can do so, unsurprisingly, with the following:
```
git commit -m "description of changes made"
```
When committing changes, a message describing them is required. The shorthand (and easiest way to do so) is with the `-m` flag followed by a description wrapped in double-quotes. 

Should you omit the `-m` flag, you will by default be redirected to a text editor to do so. Unless the changes require a massive description, try to stick with providing a message on the command line like shown above.

Running `git status` after a successful commit will no longer show staged changes. Because they've been commited!

### Pushing 
When you're ready to contribute to the `master` branch, you can do so via the `push` command:

```
git push 
```
*Pushing* updates the remote repository. By default, this will be `origin`, or the repo that was cloned from initially.

That's great, except when it's not!

**On bigger projects, you should consider the implications of directly pushing to `master`; as yet another safety net, consider creating a separate branch with your changes and pushing that.**

You can push a locally-created branch to `origin` like so:

```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

This allows for the changes to be *added* to the main repository, but final say of whether something should be *merged* to the `master` resides elsewhere. This is crucial, especially as a junior developer. It's like submitting a proposal!


## Git vs Github
**Git** is a version control system (as we've been discussing). It is a workflow that allows for tracking changes made to projects. These projects can be cloned, distributed, passed around, and contributed to.

**Github** is a cloud-based hosting service for maintaining git repositories! It's a website. It's a desktop application. It's a service. It's a social media platform (sort of). It helps oversee typical git workflow, as well as adding its own features, most notable **pull requests**. 

Pull requests allow for contributions to a codebase to be properly vetted and reviewed. This is a really powerful tool for code development and regulation.

## Final Musings

That's *git* in a nutshell! With its powerful toolkit, you and all of the people you're working with can stay on the same page and keep conflicts to a minimum! 

git:

- distributes copies of code to multiple users
- has an `origin` those users contribute their changes to
- changes must be *staged* and *committed* locally before being pushed elsewhere.
- `git status` is your best friend

git is a wonderfully, and sometimes dauntingly, large system that provides endless utility when used correctly.

For more a more extensive knowledge of git nothing beats experience. But, for familiarizing yourself with the finer points, their own [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) is a great place to go. 

For the day-to-day, however, here's a handy cheatsheet github has provided. See how many you recognize from this lesson! [Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
